# ImageNeuralNet
NeuralNet for transform images + own Image file format (in progress)

Currently being developed primarily Image File Format (IFF) part of this project. It's a first part for Image NeuralNet project.
When IFF part will be implemented to some extent, I will come back to develop the neural network part.
