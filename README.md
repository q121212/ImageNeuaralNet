# ImageNeuralNet
NeuralNet for transform images + own Image file format (in progress)

Currently being developed primarily Image File Format (IFF) part of this project. It's a first part for Image NeuralNet project.
When IFF part will be implemented to some extent, I will come back to develop the neural network part.

Models folder is a part of project for creating iconic images and storing handled images and image's galleries for different sign for ImageNeuralNet. For learning this network in future.

Extract folder is a module for extracting different objects from images. Currently is being developed by the implementation of the extraction of segments.
